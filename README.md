# Dylets - Solar Cooler Financing Platform

Dylets is a blockchain-powered fintech platform providing affordable solar cooler financing for fish traders in Kisumu, Kenya, reducing post-harvest losses and increasing incomes.

## Project Overview

This platform connects fish traders with solar cooler financing using USDC stablecoins on the Base blockchain. The RejSola solar coolers maintain optimal temperature (0-4Â°C) to keep fish fresh for days, reducing spoilage by up to 30%.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Vite
- **Blockchain**: Solidity, Hardhat, Ethers.js
- **Network**: Base Mainnet
- **Token**: USDC (0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913)

## Smart Contract Architecture

The main contract `DyletsLoanContract.sol` handles:
- Loan creation and management
- USDC payment processing
- Payment tracking and status updates
- Emergency controls for admin
